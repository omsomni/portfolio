                Dear President,
                <br><br>
                Good day, President Marcos! I would like to express my thoughts, opinions, and
                expectations from such high position in the country, the President.
                <br><br>
                To start off, I would like to say that being a president must be extremely pressuring and hard. I
                congratulate the president for winning the election. To file for president is also a very challenging and
                serious matter, and I commend the President for his bravery. In my opinion, someone who wants to file
                and become the President, one must be filled with responsibility, critical thinking, opposed to
                corruption, sympathy and empathy. These traits are what a president should acknowledge and possess.
                I would like to express my expectations from the president. The poverty, the corruption, the world-wide
                issues, criminal cases, and murder. These are, for me, what the Philippines are going through. By being
                the president, I hope that these will be looked upon and give attention, and most importantly solved. It
                may take time, the amount of money that needs to be invested in solving these issues are huge and
                should be given a sufficient budget. But as far as I know, the Philippines is in great debt to a country, and
                thus should be issued and solved immediately in order to create a great and peaceful environment for
                the Filipinos.
                <br><br>
                To summarize, I congratulate and commend your bravery. Being a president comes with great
                responsibility and issues that needs to be solved within and outside the government. I, as a Filipino,
                expect the President and the government to solve these issues alongside the many different matters in
                the economy. Thank you and have a good day!
            </p>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every country needs rules and regulations to keep a normal and peaceful community.
                These rules and regulations should be mandatory to avoid any harm to its people. Thus, everyone
                should abide by their country’s rules and regulations. However, not everyone is willing to,
                therefore the government provides service and assistance in monitoring people’s misbehavior
                and provide support for the people that need protection. Through the government, the police
                department was made. The Philippine National Police’s motto, which is “To Serve and to
                Protect,” has given the community a chance to create an environment that everyone can feel
                protected, feel safe, and protected. Protection is what the PNP aims to fill in times of situations
                that need much more than safety.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main aim of the police is to protect the nation from different kinds of wrongdoings.
                The PNP’s police force and some of its actions are documented which can be found on the
                internet. Some examples are provided below, which are scaled with 1, being highly inefficient, to
                10, being highly efficient, that are based on how the police officers fulfilled their duty and
                service on our society.
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first news article cited is a manila cop that is facing criminal and admin cases over
                killing of a delivery rider. The article talks about the police report made about the homicide case.
                The cop involved is friends with the victim, who were waiting outside of a barangay hall when
                suddenly the cop was playing with his gun and allegedly went off and hit the victim. This caused
                a stir on the department, as the cops’ irresponsible gun handling led to a person’s death, due to
                the police officer’s mishandling, this case is given a 1, which is highly inefficient.
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second report is about a police officer that quickly responded to a robbery incident.
                According to the report, a complaint from a student victim, the Buhangin, Davao City responded
                immediately. An 18-year-old female was walking on September 24, when a motorcycle with two
                male suspects stopped and pointed an unknown caliber pistol at her and declared a hold up. The
                student’s bag containing one cellphone worth ₱7,000 and cash amounting to ₱1,570 and other
                personal belongings was taken. The police ended up chasing the robbers, however, one suspect
                was able to evade arrest. The back rider of the motorcycle fired his homemade revolver towards
                the police which the police returned fire to. The injured suspect that was shot by the police was
                immediately rushed to the hospital but was later declared dead on arrival, the suspect’s identity is
                still unknown. Although the police were able to chase and catch a suspect, the other was able to
                run and evade his/her arrest. Considering the injured suspect died due to them firing a pistol
                towards the officers, and the officers had no other choice but to fire back. The efficiency of the
                police, in this case, is 7.
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and last report is about the police seizing millions of drugs, mainly shabu and
                dried marijuana, in a single day. According to the report, ₱4.5 million worth of shabu were
                collected in a series of anti-illegal drugs operations on Saturday, September 24, 2022. Aside
                from shabu, the cops confiscated 138 bricks and 6 tubular forms of dried marijuana leaves in the
                Kalinga province, resulting in a total estimated value of ₱17,280,000. Due to this being done
                within a day, this case is given a 10, which is highly efficient.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on these three reports about the efficiency of the Philippine National Police in
                fulfilling their functions in our society, the average of their efficiency is 6 from the scale of 1
                (being highly inefficient) to 10 (being highly efficient.) The three cases mentioned above are just
                examples and is subjective to what the police can do. Police authorities can and will still be able
                to act in accordance with their motto, “To Serve and to Protect.”

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the presidency of the former President Rodrigo Duterte, a campaign was built to battle
                drug activity within the society. Eliminating malicious drug activity in our country was necessary due to
                how it was one of the bigger problems presented by the government. Hence, the president introduces the
                campaign against drugs or the “war on drugs” in the Philippines.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drugs in general are substances that some people take for whatever reason. However, killing
                innocent people was also involved. In the first place, death or murder is against the way of life. It is also
                included in the 10 commandments that teaches us how to live and how to follow Jesus. Since some
                innocent people were killed during the war on drugs, it definitely violated the life of an individual. Many
                cases that were involved in war of drugs were successful. However, some cases, it is said that police
                disregarded human rights. Since we, as viewers, do not have an idea of what really happened, it is easier
                for us to judge. Although I am not saying that police did not do their job, because they did. They just did
                what they were ordered to do. The campaign states that a platform was urging people to kill drug addicts.
                By this statement alone, it can be said that the campaign violated the lives of individuals that essentially
                became victims. Due to the high number of unnecessary killings, Human Rights Watch research found
                that police were making false testimonies that goes against them. They were trying to justify the unlawful
                killings of hundreds of people.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Campaigns are managed to help, improve, and enhance the society and free them for any unsafe
                acts. A campaign that targets drug lords, for me, was unnecessary. There are a lot of other things that is
                much more important than killing people. The funds that were given to the campaign could help more
                people, instead of punishing them. More lives will be saved,
